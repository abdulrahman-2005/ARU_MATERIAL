Please analyze this lecture PDF and create a comprehensive quiz with the following specifications:

1. Create 15 multiple choice questions that test key concepts from the lecture
2. Each question should:
   - Test understanding, not just memorization
   - Include 4 options with one correct answer
   - Have a clear explanation for the correct answer
   - Be worth 2 points
   - Include code examples where relevant

3. Format the output as a JSON object matching this structure:
{
    "title": "[Lecture Topic] Quiz",
    "course_id": "[Course ID]",
    "related_file": "[PDF filename]",
    "time_limit": 10,
    "passing_score": 70,
    "randomize_questions": true,
    "questions": [
        {
            "id": "Q1",
            "text": "[Question text - can include code blocks using ```language\ncode\n```]",
            "type": "multiple_choice", 
            "options": [
                "[Option 1]",#can include code blocks using ```language\ncode\n```
                "[Option 2]",#can include code blocks using ```language\ncode\n```
                "[Option 3]",#can include code blocks using ```language\ncode\n```
                "[Option 4]"#can include code blocks using ```language\ncode\n```
            ],
            "correct_answer": [index of correct option, 0-3],
            "points": 2,
            "explanation": "[Detailed explanation with optional code examples]"
        }
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "You have 10 minutes to complete this quiz",
        "Each question is worth 2 points",
        "You need 70% to pass",
        "All questions must be answered before submission",
        "Questions and answers are randomized for each attempt"
    ]
}

Important:
- Questions should progress from fundamental concepts to more complex applications
- Include both theoretical and practical questions
- Use code examples where appropriate, formatted with ```language\n code\n```
- Ensure explanations are clear and educational
- Make distractors (wrong options) plausible but clearly incorrect
- Cover the main topics from the lecture evenly
